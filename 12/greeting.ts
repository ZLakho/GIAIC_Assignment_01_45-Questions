// Q: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s 
// name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
//  personalized with the person’s name.

let array1 = ["Zainab lakho","Asma Aslam","Tasbiha Naz","Rameen Iqbal","Sadia Ajmal"];
for(let i=0; i<array1.length;i++){
    console.log("Hi "+array1[i]+" ! Hope you are doing well, and i have heard that you are learning typescript?")
}
