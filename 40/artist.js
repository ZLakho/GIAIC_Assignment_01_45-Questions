// Q: Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The 
// function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing
//  these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
//   albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add
//    an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If 
//    the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
//    Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
function make_album(artist, title, tracks) {
    if (tracks === void 0) { tracks = 0; }
    var album = {
        artist: artist,
        title: title,
        // track: tracks
    };
    album.tracks = tracks;
    return album;
