// Q: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always 
// receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an
// optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored
// correctly.

        Model: model,
        Color: color,
        Features: features
    };
    // Car_info.Color = color;
    // Car_info.feature=features;
